        <h2>▷ Artifical Intelligence (AI):</h2>
        <p>     AI focuses on creating machines that mimic human intelligence. It involves machine learning, natural language processing, and problem-solving
        algorithms. In contrast to Software Engineering, which deals with creating applications, AI focuses on creating systems that can make
        intelligent decisions autonomously.</p>

        <h2>▷ Computer Graphics:</h2>
        <p>Computer Graphics involves creating visual content using computers, including 2D and 3D images and animations. It's utilized in gaming, animation, and
        design. In comparison to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), which focuses on user interfaces, Computer Graphics is more about visual representation.</p>

        <h2>▷ Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):</h2>
        <p>HCI studies how people interact with computers and how to design user-friendly interfaces. It considers user behavior and psychology. In contrast to Data 
        Science, which deals with large datasets, HCI focuses on improving the user experience.</p>

        <h2>▷ Databases:</h2>
        <p>Databases manage and organize data efficiently, enabling storage and retrieval. It involves database design, management, and querying. In comparison to 
        Networking, which handles communication between devices, Databases focus on data manipulation.</p>

        <h2>▷ Networking:</h2>
        <p>Networking involves designing and managing communication networks. It covers protocols, security, and wireless technologies. In contrast to Theoretical Computer
        Science, which deals with algorithms, Networking focuses on the physical and logical connections between devices.</p>

        <h2>▷ Software Engineering:</h2>
        <p>Software Engineering focuses on systematic software development, including design, testing, and maintenance. It aims for efficient and reliable applications. 
        Compared to Computer Security, which focuses on protecting systems, Software Engineering is more about the development process.</p>

        <h2>▷ Theoretical Computer Science:</h2>
        <p>Theoretical Computer Science studies the mathematical foundations of computation, algorithms, and complexity. It's concerned with what can be computed and 
        how. In contrast to Information Systems, which applies technology in business, Theoretical Computer Science is more theoretical and abstract.</p>

        <h2>▷ Information Systems:</h2>
        <p>Information Systems apply technology to manage and process information in business contexts. It includes enterprise software and decision support systems.
         Compared to Artificial Intelligence, which aims for intelligent behavior, Information Systems focus on operational efficiency.</p>

        <h2>▷ Cryptography:</h2>
        <p>Cryptography secures communication through mathematical techniques. It includes encryption and decryption methods. In contrast to Cloud Computing, 
        which provides remote services, Cryptography is about ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.</p>

        <h2>▷ Data Science:</h2>
        <p>Data Science extracts insights from large datasets using statistics and machine learning. It's applied in various fields for decision-making.
         In comparison to Robotics, which deals with physical machines, Data Science focuses on data analysis.</p>

        <h2>▷ Computer Security:</h2>
        <p>Computer Security protects systems and data from threats. It includes cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and encryption. In contrast to Artificial
         Intelligence, which aims for intelligent behavior, Computer Security safeguards against malicious actions.</p>

        <h2>▷ Bioinformatics:</h2>
        <p>Bioinformatics applies computation to biological data analysis. It's used in genomics and drug discovery. Compared to Quantum Computing, which 
        explores advanced computation, Bioinformatics relates more to biological sciences.</p>

        <h2>▷ Quantum Computing:</h2>
        <p>Quantum Computing leverages quantum-mechanical phenomena for computation. It's capable of solving complex problems faster than classical 
        computers. In contrast to Software Engineering, which focuses on practical development, Quantum Computing is at the forefront of computation innovation.</p>

        <h2>▷ Cloud Computing:</h2>
        <p>Cloud Computing delivers computing resources over the internet, enabling scalable and on-demand services. It covers IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Compared to 
        Databases, which manage data storage, Cloud Computing focuses on service delivery.</p>

        <h2>▷ Robotics:</h2>
        <p>Robotics designs, constructs, and operates robots for various applications. It involves AI, mechanics, and electronics. In comparison to Machine 
        Learning, which enables systems to learn from data, Robotics focuses on physical interaction and movement.</p>
